# Booru Autotagger for Eagle

This project provides a complete package for automatically tagging images in [Eagle](https://eagle.cool/) using Booru tags. The way it works is these two parts:

1. **Booru Image Processor**: A standalone application that processes images through the Booru API and saves tag data as JSON files
2. **Eagle Plugin**: A plugin for Eagle that reads these JSON files and applies the tags to your images. Keep in mind the Json files will be named after the image itself. So for example
if the image is named earth.png the json is named earth.json. That way with the Eagle plugin it will just find the correct json for the correct image using the json file names. You can download the
Eagle Plugin from the repo. It would be on Eagle's community plugins but they still haven't reviewed it.

## Requirements

- Running instance of [Danbooru Autotagger API](https://github.com/danbooru/autotagger) (at http://localhost:5000) For it to work properly.
- [Eagle](https://eagle.cool/) application (version 2.0 or later)

## Part 1: Booru Image Processor

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using the executable (Windows)
1. Download the Booru Processor.exe from the release
2. Run the executable

#### Option 2: Running from source
1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v14+)
2. Clone/download this repository
3. Open a terminal in the `booru-processor` directory
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the application: `npm start`

### Usage

1. **Start the Application**: The application will automatically start a permanent Docker API instance on first run. This instance will remain running in the background to ensure reliable operation.

2. **Configure the Processor**:
   - Enter the API endpoint (default: http://localhost:5000/evaluate)
   - Set your confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
   - Click "Browseâ€¦" to select one or multiple folders containing your images
   - Choose whether to include subfolders for processing

3. **Processing Options**:
   - **API Instances**: Select up to 10 concurrent API instances for faster processing (requires more system memory)
   - **Processing Mode**:
     - Process all images
     - Process only new images (skip previously processed)
     - Reprocess only images with missing JSON files
   - The application will automatically analyze selected folders and recommend the appropriate mode

4. **Process Your Images**:
   - Click "Process Images" to start
   - A "Json" subfolder will be created in each of your selected directories
   - Each image will be processed and its tags saved as a JSON file

5. **Control Processing**:
   - Use the "Pause" button to temporarily halt processing
   - Use "Resume" to continue after pausing
   - Use "Cancel" to abort the process entirely
   - View real-time progress for each API instance

6. **Advanced Features**:
   - **Auto-Recovery**: The application automatically retries failed requests
   - **Connection Management**: Sophisticated connection handling prevents socket hangups
   - **Resource Optimization**: The permanent API instance stays running while additional instances are started only when needed
   - **Error Handling**: Intelligent error handling with automatic connection pool reset

### JSON Format

The Booru API returns tag data in this format:

```json
[
{
 "filename": "image.jpg",
 "tags": {
   "1girl": 0.9995526671409607,
   "hatsune_miku": 0.9995216131210327,
   "vocaloid": 0.9981155395507812
 }
}
]
